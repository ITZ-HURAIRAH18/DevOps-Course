Images vs Containers in Docker

Image: It is the Blue Print of our Project which show all thing that what dependencies are we used in it 
Important: It is Immutable 
For Easier it is look like a class (OOP)

Containers:It is used to run the Image
Important:It is Isolated Means if we have a project that need Node so Docker run this without Node.js
For Easier it is look like a Object (OOP)
