Images vs Containers in Docker

Image: It is the Blue Print of our Project which show all thing that what dependencies are we used in it 
Important: It is Immutable 
For Easier it is look like a class (OOP)

Containers:It is used to run the Image
Important:It is Isolated Means if we have a project that need Node so Docker run this without Node.js
For Easier it is look like a Object (OOP)

Docker Hub vs Docker Desktop

Docker Hub: It i Cloud Platform where we store and pull Images 
Docker Desktop: It is th platform where we can run Docker in out PC

Base (Parent) Image:It is the image like we donot want to write the code of nodejs so we used this import 
from Node like this way

---------------------------------------------------------
 Create a Docker Image for a Node.js App Using Dockerfile

# Use official Node.js runtime as base image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application files
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]


Create image: docker build -t name .
